# anycsv
This is a robust CSV parser for Python 3 (Python 2 is NOT supported), based on the
default csv Python module.

## Install
1. `git clone git@github.com:inpher/anycsv.git`
2. `python setup.py install`

## Run Test
A test is included that reads a csv, changes its delimiter to '|', and writes it
to "testfile.csv".
Run `python3 test.py` to run the test.
